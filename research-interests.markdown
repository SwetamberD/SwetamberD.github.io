# Classical Density Theory

I am currently focused on developing a classical density theory that draws
remarkable parallels with the density matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.
Our theory is designed to ensure norm-preserving dynamics and is applicable to
both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems.

One major finding of this theory is that it has allowed us to obtain first
time-information uncertainty relations for deterministic systems, including
those that are relevant to Lyapunov exponents and phase space dissipation rate.
This theory also leads to the maximum speed on thermodynamic entropy production
with deep connections with deterministic fluctuation theorems.

An interesting new element that has emerged from this work is a classical
Fisher information specifically tailored for deterministic differentiable
dynamics analogous to quantum Fisher information. This information measure
directly connects the phase space geometry with the instability of a dynamical
system.
