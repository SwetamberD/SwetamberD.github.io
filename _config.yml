about_content: | 

        I am a theoretical physicist in the [Green Research Group](https://www.jasonrgreen.net/) at UMass Boston as a research assistant professor. My research interests lie at the **intersection of dynamical systems and non-equilibrium physics**.

        Before moving to Boston, I was a visiting scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany. From 2017 to 2019, I collaborated with [Prof. Arnd BÃ¤cker](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/physik/itp/cp/die-professur/baecker?set_language=en) at TU Dresden.

       I completed my doctoral studies in physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai, India. Under the guidance of [Prof. Neelima M. Gupte](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/faculty-inner.php?fuid=55), I defended my thesis in March 2018.

       In addition to my research endeavors, I have a strong interest in organizing scientific outreach programs aimed at engaging the wider community.

          I am currently focused on developing a classical density theory that draws remarkable parallels with the density matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Our theory is designed to ensure norm-preserving dynamics and is applicable to both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems.

          One major breakthrough of this theory is that it provides a family of <mark>time-information uncertainty relations</mark> for deterministic systems, including those that are relevant to Lyapunov exponents and phase space dissipation rate. Another success is that the theory has led to a <mark>classical speed limit on thermodynamic entropy production</mark>.

          Working at NatWest as a front end engineer focusing mostly on a corporate banking product called Bankline.
          Working as part of a scrum team consiting of 5 developers, 2 testers and a PO/BA I have the oportunity to help drive the team forwards and
          work with the PO defining what we are building.

          I spend most of my time working on a specifc area of a large application that our team take ownership over. The front end is a <mark>React</mark> app
          that talks to an API built using a collection of <mark>Java</mark> microservices. I have spent time working in multiple parts of the stack including
          helping to define our front end architecure to follow best practices to implementing PDF and CSV export in a microservice.

          Last year I took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. I worked with the architects and designers to create something that would
          be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for years to come. I then built this to a high standard which lead to a seamless switch over from the previous
          system with no issues. More recently I have acted as a consultant to external teams and application architects to advise on how we should be building new
          functionality within our application. I have also built reusable components to the same standards as opensource libraries which have been used by different teams across the bank.

          I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to
