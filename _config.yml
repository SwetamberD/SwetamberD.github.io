  I am a theoretical physicist working in the [Green Research Group](https://www.jasonrgreen.net/) at UMass Boston as a research assistant professor. My research interests lie at the **intersection of dynamical systems and non-equilibrium physics**.

  Before moving to Boston, I was a visiting scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany. From 2017 to 2019, I collaborated with [Prof. Arnd BÃ¤cker](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/physik/itp/cp/die-professur/baecker?set_language=en) at TU Dresden.

  I completed my doctoral studies in physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai, India. Under the guidance of [Prof. Neelima M. Gupte](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/faculty-inner.php?fuid=55), I defended my thesis in March 2018.

  In addition to my research endeavors, I have a strong interest in organizing scientific outreach programs aimed at engaging the wider community.

        description: |
          With [Prof. Jason R. Green](https://www.jasonrgreen.net/publications), I am currently focused on developing a classical density theory that draws remarkable parallels with the density matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Our theory is designed to ensure norm-preserving dynamics and is applicable to both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems.

          One major breakthrough of this theory is that it has allowed us to obtain *first-ever* <mark>time-information uncertainty relations</mark> for deterministic systems, including those that are relevant to Lyapunov exponents and phase space dissipation rate. Another success is that the theory leads to a <mark>classical speed limit on thermodynamic entropy production</mark> with deep connections with deterministic fluctuation theorems.

          A compelling new element that has emerged from this work is a <mark>classical Fisher information</mark> specifically tailored for deterministic dynamics analogous to quantum Fisher information. This information measure directly connects the *phase space geometry with the instability of a dynamical system*.
