        <p>Our research lies at the intersection of dynamical systems and non-equilibrium physics,
        aiming to understand how physical systems interact with their environment.
        These interactions give rise to emergent phenomena across various scales of length, time, and energy,
        from the formation of self assembly patterns in chemical reactions to the functioning of
        biological cells essential for life. Our aim is to understand the dynamical mechanism
        of these processes in order to inform and guide experiments toward
        designing synthetic systems. To tackle these challenges, we leverage
        a diverse set of analytical methods and computational tools.</p>
